# Tables updated by PuppetDB commands in 5.2.x (PE 2018.1.x)

## Catalogs

* `certnames`
* `catalogs`
* `catalogs_resources`
* `edges`
* `resource_params`
* `resource_params_cache`

These last two are small and probably don't need to be repacked unless an
explain analyze is showing poor performance there.

* `environments`
* `producers`

## Factsets

* `certnames`
* `factsets`
* `fact_paths`

If package inventory is enabled

* `certname_packages`
* `packages`

These last two are small and probably don't need to be repacked unless an
explain analyze is showing poor performance there.

* `environments`
* `producers`

## Reports

* `certnames`
* `reports`
* `resource_events`

These last three are small and probably don't need to be repacked unless an
explain analyze is showing poor performance there.

* `report_statuses`
* `environments`
* `producers`
