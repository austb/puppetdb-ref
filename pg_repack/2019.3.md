# Tables updated by PuppetDB commands in 6.7.x (PE 2019.2.x)

## Catalogs

* `certnames`
* `catalogs`
* `catalogs_resources`
* `edges`
* `resource_params`
* `resource_params_cache`

If `puppetserver` has the `track-lookups` setting enabled.

* `catalog_inputs`

These last two are small and probably don't need to be repacked unless an
explain analyze is showing poor performance there.

* `environments`
* `producers`

## Factsets

* `certnames`
* `factsets`
* `fact_paths`

If package inventory is enabled

* `certname_packages`
* `packages`

These last two are small and probably don't need to be repacked unless an
explain analyze is showing poor performance there.

* `environments`
* `producers`

## Reports

* `certnames`
* `reports`
* `resource_events` (and `resource_events_YYYYMMDDz` partitions)

These last three are small and probably don't need to be repacked unless an
explain analyze is showing poor performance there.

* `report_statuses`
* `environments`
* `producers`
